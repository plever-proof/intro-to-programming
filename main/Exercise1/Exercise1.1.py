# This is the first program everyone writes and it's called a hello world program

# Why? -> https://dev.to/just5moreminutes/why-hello-world-5c0g mainly because someone thought
# it was fun in the 1960's!  

# The hash tag or pound sign signifies a comment in python.  Comments can be used to explain 
# how to do something, what something is doing... prevent code from running..

# The main function where a program starts
if __name__ == "__main__":

    # This is a variable it holds well... anything!  It allows you to store and modify small 
    # amounts of data while you run your program.  This variable is a str type that holds 
    # a string called "Hello World"
    my_string = "Hello World"

    # The print function very useful to display characters and for debugging!
    print(my_string)

# Question 1:
# Can you print out your name?

# Question 2:
# What happens if you try to run the program if you comment out the "print" line?
