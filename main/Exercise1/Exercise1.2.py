# Exercise 1.2


# The "hashtag" or "pound" sign '#' is used to create a comment in code comments are just flavor for
# a computer program they describe, note, help developers keep track of thoughts and ideas when writing code



# This is a "main" function it's the entry point for a computer program not all languages use/have main
# but the concept is universal.  This is where the program starts.
if __name__ == "__main__":

    
    my_string = "Hello World" # This is a variable, variables can hold well... anything!  
    # They're the most fundamental building block of any computer program

    # Prints or other statements are mainly used for debugging they write data to the console or terminal
    # I'm not going to get into what that is exactly but think of it as the "backrooms" of any computer 
    # operating system.  If you become a professional programmer you'll become VERY familiar with the terminal
    print(my_string)

    another_variable = "Twas brilig when the slithy toves did gimble and gyre in the wabe.  All mimsy were the borogroves and the momeraths outgrabe."


# Question 1:
# Can you create a new variable and store a number in it?

# Question 2:
# Why doesn't the program print out the poem stored in "another_variable"?
